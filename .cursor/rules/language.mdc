# Language Rules

## Always use English for code and documentation

- All code comments must be written in English
- All variable names, function names, class names, and file names must use English words
- All documentation (README files, JSDoc comments, etc.) must be written in English
- All commit messages must be in English
- All error messages and user-facing text should be in English
- All test descriptions and assertions should be in English

This ensures consistency across the codebase and makes it accessible to a broader range of developers.
